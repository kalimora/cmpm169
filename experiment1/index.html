				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I am trying to replicate what I see when I hear "The Line" by Twenety One Pilots. A song that was used for the show "Arcane" and what I used to decide on the colors for my art piece.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The code was seperated into two files for me to easily edit the functions that I had created. I created a Mold file to easily edit how the lines looked and behavior of my art worked. I also defined my curve lines in a seperate function that is toggled when the mouse is clicked. Overall, the technial side of the art piece is very straightforward and can be seen on my github and documentation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was the only person who worked on this code. I enjoyed the process of how I got to my end result, especially as someone who is still constantly learning how to code and to develop me JavaScript skills. There was a lot of trial and error and scoping to finish this assignment in a decent amount of time. </p>
