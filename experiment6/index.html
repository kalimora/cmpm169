				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In 'Mood Tracker,' I explore the visualization of emotional states over time through an interactive calendar. This project allows users to record their daily moods using a color coded system, offering a visual representation of mood variations throughout the year. By providing a platform to monitor emotional trends, this application aims to enhance self-awareness and emotional well-being. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> The core of this application involves creating an interactive calendar that users can engage with to track their moods. Each day on the calendar can be color-coded according to the user's mood, using predefined colors associated with different emotional states like happiness, sadness, anger, and excitement. The calendar accounts for leap years, ensuring accurate day tracking. Users can click on any day to update their mood and add notes for more detailed reflection. Data is saved locally on the user's device to maintain their history across sessions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> Starting this project, I drew inspiration from my routine journaling habit, aiming to digitize and simplify the process of mood tracking. The idea was sparked by the potential of interactive calendars in personal health tech, particularly for mental health tracking.  </p>
