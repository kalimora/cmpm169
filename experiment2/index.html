				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I am trying to replicate a day and night cycle with generative methods that the user can control by clicking on the image to change it to day or night. I was also able to further learn and create lunar phases in this experiment and replicate clouds! Every time it turns night, look at the moon to notice the changes!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The day and night cycle is controlled through a draw() function that updates the canvas based on the isDay variable, which toggles upon user click. The lunar phases are managed using an array of objects, each detailing visual offsets and full moon status, affecting the moon's visual representation based on the moonPhaseIndex. Clouds are procedurally generated and stored in an array, with each object maintaining its position, size, and speed to simulate movement across the screen. When clouds traverse beyond the canvas, they reset to continue the cycle seamlessly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project alone and thoroughly enjoyed the process. The main challenge was synchronizing the day and night transitions with the lunar phases, which required rendering adjustments. It was rewarding to see the interactive elements come together, creating a dynamic simulation that responds to the user's inputs. </p>
