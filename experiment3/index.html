				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I aimed to recreate a visually iconic scene from Cyberpunk 2077, where the main characters V and Johnny are enveloped in a glitch/holographic effect. Inspired by this, I developed an interactive web application that allows users to manipulate live video footage to simulate their own version of this Cyberpunk scene. By using user input, participants can dynamically alter the visual elements, adding blue glitch effects to the scene, making each interaction unique and personal.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> I started by setting up a live video feed from the user's webcam, which serves as the canvas for the glitch effects. To achieve the holographic glitch effect, I used motion detection algorithms that analyze the difference between consecutive video frames to identify movement. When movement is detected, a red glitch effect is applied to these areas. Additionally, I implemented an interactive feature where users can move their mouse over the video to change parts of the glitch effect from red to blue, creating a dynamic interaction that mimics the aesthetic of Cyberpunk 2077. The intensity of this effect gradually fades, adding a trailing visual that enhances the cybernetic feel of the interaction.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I worked on it by myself. I did encounter several challenges and learning opportunities. One of the main difficulties was the motion detection to responsively and accurately apply the glitch effect. The success of creating a visually appealing and interactive piece that effectively captured the essence of Cyberpunk 2077's aesthetic was incredibly rewarding. This project not only enhanced my technical skills in working with real-time video capturing but also deepened my understanding of interactive media design.</p>
