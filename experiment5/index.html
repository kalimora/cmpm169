				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In 'I am Human,' I explore the nuances of identity and humanity through an interactive ASCII art piece using real-time webcam footage. This project captures the viewer's image and transforms it into ASCII art, overlaid with the phrase 'I am human'. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> The core of this application involves capturing video through a webcam and converting the live images into ASCII art. This ASCII representation uses a dynamically changing text, "I am human" and "I am not", to reflect on the human condition. The text changes in response to user interaction, specifically clicking on the canvas, which toggles between the two phrases. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I started this project having background from a pervious assignment on how to use the user's webcam to create art. Which set me up to have an idea of how to start and continue.  I was inspired by the ASCII art style and its potential to convey deep themes using simple text characters. Overall, a very fun project and with a twisted message that I decided to go with because of Detroit Becomes Human, a game that follows technology and redefining what is 'human'. </p>
